Tux Disc is a command line utility for downloading ISO images for Ubuntu and it's flavors, as well as KDE neon.

Tux Disc provides a simple, easy to use interface, that makes it a breeze to download Ubuntu ISO images.

This is pretty much a little project of mine born from my wanting to choose which Ubuntu flavor's 17.10 daily testing ISO I wanted to download, and just kinda ended up becoming this whole thing for downloading a bunch of Linux distributions install images.

Planned Features
================

In no particular order, these are some features/milestones that I have planned for future development

* Graphical user interface (buttons everywhere!)
* Flatpak/Snap packaging (for easier cross-distro distribution)
* Complete recoding into Python (Might make the GUI easier, and should make it easier to port to other OSes)
